#summary How to build pythontracer

= Download =
Use the links in the "Downloads" tab above to get the latest release, or use svn.

= Prerequisites for *building* pythontracer =
  * [http://www.python.org Python]
  * [http://www.cosc.canterbury.ac.nz/greg.ewing/python/Pyrex/ Pyrex]
    * [http://www.cosc.canterbury.ac.nz/greg.ewing/python/Pyrex/packages/0.9.3.1/Pyrex-0.9.3.1.win32.exe Pyrex 0.9.3.1 for Windows package]

On Debian (or Ubuntu, etc) use:
{{{
sudo apt-get install python-pyrex
}}}

On Windows: 
  * You will also need something to extract .tar.gz files, such as [http://www.7-zip.org/ 7-zip].
  * You will need stuff as described in [http://boodebr.org/main/python/build-windows-extensions building with free tools]. (Specifically, you'll need [http://www.mingw.org/ MinGW] which you can try getting in that link or try [http://kent.dl.sourceforge.net/sourceforge/mingw/MinGW-5.1.3.exe a direct download of MinGW-5.1.3.exe].)
  * After installing MinGW you may need to create the following batch file:
    {{{
@echo off

echo MinGW Enviroment Command Console
echo ....
echo ....
@set MINGWROOT=C:\MinGW
@set MINGWBIN=%MINGWROOT%\bin
@set MINGWINCLUDE=%MINGWROOT%\include
@set MINGWLIB=%MINGWROOT%\lib
@set MINGWLIBEXEC=%MINGWROOT%\libexec\gcc\mingw32\3.4.5
@set MINGWBIN2=%MINGWROOT%\mingw32\bin
@set MINGWLIB2=%MINGWROOT%\mingw32\lib\ldscripts
@set MINGW=%MINGWROOT%;%MINGWBIN%;%MINGWINCLUDE%;%MINGWLIB%;%MINGWLIBEXEC%;%MINGWLIB2%;%MINGWLIB2%

rem to add more resource paths just use the set command like above and the and it to the set PATH like below

@set Path=%MINGW%;%Path%
}}}

Save this as a .bat file and run it inside a cmd.exe prompt to get the proper environment.

= Building =
  # Extract the archive.
  # Open a terminal (or cmd.exe in Windows)
  # cd to the directory pytracer/tracer
  # run: `python setup.py bdist` or `bdsit_wininst` (for a windows installation package)
