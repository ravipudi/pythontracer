== Creating a trace ==

To use the tracer, just run pytracefile.py with a Python source.

For example, if you have a program that you run:

{{{
python mygame.py arg1 arg2
}}}

Then just run:

{{{
pytracefile.py mygame.py arg1 arg2
}}}

Note: The python paths are not currently fixed in accordance with normal script running, so you may need to use PYTHONPATH=<scriptpath> pytracefile.py ....    in order for it to run correctly.


This will create or overwrite a profile/trace output file called "profile.out".
You can rename this to whatever you wish, but there is currently no way to control the output filename from pytracefile.py itself.

== Viewing a trace ==

To view the trace, just run:

{{{
pytracerview.py profile.out
}}}
